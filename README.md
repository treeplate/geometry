## Points and things made of points
### Point
A point is any capital letter (A-Z).
### Line
Lines extends infinitely in both directions. A line is written `<AB>`, where A and B are two points on the line.
### Ray
Rays extend infinitely in one direction. A ray is written `-AB>`, where A is the endpoint and B is another point on the ray.
### Line Segment
A Segment is a finite segment of a line. A segment is written `-AB-`, where A and B are the two endpoints. The length of a segment is written `AB`.
### Angle
An angle is two rays with the same endpoint. An angle is written `<ABC`, where B is the endpoint and A and C are points, one on each ray. The measure of an angle (in radians) is written `m<ABC`.
### Triangle
An triangle is 3 line segments with 3 total endpoints. A triangle is written `^ABC`, where A,B,and C are the three endpoints.
## Operations
### Parallel
To say that `<AB>` and `<CD>` are parallel, say `<AB> || <CD>`.
### Perpendicular
To say that `<AB>` is perpendicular to `<CD>`, say `<AB> _|_ <CD>`
